# Bikepacking gear

I often receive inquiries about my personal gear and cycling equipment choices, bikepacking essentials, pack lists etc. To address these questions and provide a comprehensive resource, I decided to create a "Bikepacking gear master list" encompassing all the essential items. This document is continually updated, serving as a reference for fellow enthusiasts to compare with their own lists and extract valuable insights. As I am constantly refining my own kit, this list remains an ever-evolving work.

A few things to keep in mind:

- While this list may seem extensive, it is tailored for more demanding scenarios like solo bikepacking, cycle touring, or self-supported rides in remote backcountry areas. Much of this list is too much for a quick local loop ride in the afternoon. However, starting with a comprehensive list allows you to customize it based on your specific needs.
- Each item on the list comes with my personal endorsement, earned through testing and use during many kilometers of riding.
- For your convenience, some of the items have hyperlinks that direct you to Amazon. As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.

Feel free to delve into the details, compare it with your own setup, and find the perfect gear combination that suits your individual style of riding. Remember, bikepacking and cycling adventures are as much about the journey as they are about the destination, and having the right equipment can make all the difference. Happy pedaling!

I've had this beauty since high school. I take good care of it and it still works without any problems. In fact, it has become so close to my heart that despite the desire for a new bike, I cannot find a suitable one that could replace the one I have. I know 26 inches is old fashioned by today's standards, but this is how I roll. 

**Update 2024**: just bought a new/used bike - **Trek Supercaliber 9.9 XX1 AXS 2022 Red Project One** ...yeay! :smile:

## Bags/carriers

**Rear rack** (Trek 7000) - [Bor Yueh BY 309](https://www.boryueh.com/en/alloy-carrier/172-by-309)

Extremely light, quick to install. It has a panel that stops some of the mud from splashing on things and your back. Mounted on Trek 7000.

**Rear rack/cargo pack** (Trek Supercaliber) - [Tailfin CargoPack](https://www.tailfin.cc/cargopack/)

With alu arch and universal thru axle mount. Expensive. Easy to mount. Completely waterproof. No rattling even on rough terrain.

**Framebag** (Trek 7000) - [Giant Scout Framebag L](https://www.freestyle.si/torbica-giant-scout-frame-bag-l::12805163)

Relatively cheap. The zippers are durable. The original is not 100% waterproof, so I sealed the seams with silicone. It has enough separate compartments for packing. Enables the installation of a water bladder.

**Seatpost Bag** (Trek 7000) - [Ortlieb Seatpack L 16.5 L](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FWZOT8Q?tag=ferjan-20)

Light, durable. It has an air release valve. If you plan to pack full, I would recommend buying an additional strap for stabilization, I made the strap and buckle for stabilization myself.

**Handlebar Bag** (Trek 7000 & Trek Supercaliber) - [Vaude Trailfront Bag 19 L](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/dp/B07NZXN56B?tag=ferjan-21)

The bag together with the carrier is not the lightest. But it is really big (only suitable for MTB handlebars).  Makes it easy to remove when it's time to sleep. Ideal for those who need more space. The upper part of the bag carrier has additional clips that allow the installation of some other lighter piece of equipment. I use this bag if i need to carry camping equipment.

**Fuelbag** (Trek 7000) - [Topeak Toploader 0.75 L](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M9AFWHT?tag=ferjan-20)

Great for powerbars, electrolyte tablets, battery packs, headphones, small sunscreen, and more. It opens/closes easily, with one hand.  It is not 100% waterproof, but it has a built-in rain cover.

**Long Top Tube Bag** (Trek Supercaliber) - [Tailfin Long Top Tube Bag 3L](https://www.tailfin.cc/long-top-tube-bag/)

Expensive. Easy to mount. Does not scratch the frame. Completely waterproof. Great for all the things that you need to quickly access during the ride. 

**Downtube Pack** (Trek Supercaliber) - [Tailfin Downtube Pack 1,7L](https://www.tailfin.cc/product/frame-fork-bags/downtube-packs/downtube-packs/)

I mostly carry tools and heavy items in this pack. It gets dirty during the ride. The cargo pack is made out of durable material and also protects my frame from flying stone/rock projectiles that could otherwise damage the frame.

**Handlebar Bottle Holder** (2x on Trek 7000) - [Decathlon Riverside](https://www.decathlon.si/p/168751-70213_nosilec-za-bidon-iz-tkanine-za-na-krmilo.html)

Best buy in Decathlon. Super useful.  For water bottles, phone, chocolates, cold beer, anything.  Everything is directly at hand, at the most easily accessible point.  Mandatory purchase!

**Handlebar Bottle Holder** (2x on Trek Supercaliber) - [Geosmina Stem Pouch Bag 0,5L](https://www.veb-company.si/izdelek/GEO11064/torba-geosmina)

A perfect upgrade from Decathlon pouch bags. Sturdier than Decathlon. Separated closing/opening cords. With integrated outer mesh. Harder to find on stock and at lest double the price compared to Decathlon pouch bags mentioned above.

**Fork Bottle Holder** (2x on Trek 7000) - [Topeak Shuttle cage AL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000FICBRM?tag=ferjan-20)

Light, durable. Bottles do not fly out even when driving on rough terrain.  Since I didn't have screws for the fork, I made them with water pipe clamps and adjustable brackets from Decathlon.

**Bottle** (4x) - [Decathlon Triban Softflow 650 ml](https://www.decathlon.si/p/168916-52581_turkizen-kolesarski-bidon-za-vodo-softflow-650-ml.html)

Cheap bottle. It does its job. There is nothing more to say.

**Soft Flask** - [Salomon Soft Flask 250ml](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09P2JZ996?tag=ferjan-20)

An ideal bottle for home-made soft-gels.  The stopper seals perfectly. I carry the gel in this bottle in the back pocket of my t-shirt and use it to add energy during the most strenuous work. Be sure to buy Salomon and not a fake, which is not comparable to the quality of the original.
